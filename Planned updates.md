Planned things for future updates:
  
v1.8:
- [X] Cleaned some code  
- [X] Now crashing won't make you quit the game. It will instead send you back to the main menu  
- [X] Dynamic modcharts loading  
- [X] Added transitionValue object (used to make a linear transition for a value given a start value, an end value, a start time and an end time)  
- [X] Added a value that controls the arrows transparency  
- [X] Simple modcharts can edit the arrows alpha (using transitionValue object)  
- [X] Fixed transitionValue object math  
- [X] Fixed the "You can't run" song  
- [X] Adding all mid-song alpha changes  
- [X] Simple modcharts can edit the characters alpha (using transitionValue object)  
- [X] Allowing loading multiple characters  
- [X] Now modcharts can change characters mid-game (Ex: in Sorrow, ben drown switches to alive ben at the end of the song)  
- [ ] Improving performance by using .convert_alpha() when displaying arrows using custom alpha values  
- [ ] Remove hard-coded arrow textures to use general programming (arrowTexture object)
- [ ] Modcharts (WIP, see wiki [here](https://github.com/EndersteveGamer/Friday-night-funkin-with-Pygame/wiki/Modding-guide-page))  
- [ ] Maybe notes color customisation?
