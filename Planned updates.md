Planned things for future updates:

v1.10:
- [ ] Heavy rework of the code to make it clearer and easier to update

- [ ] Current volume display when pressing - or +
- [ ] Notes skins offsets
- [ ] Adding all the missing things from v1.9

Future things with no defined update:
  - Adding all animated backgrounds
  - Main menu rework
  - Notes color customisation
  - Add more modchart features
