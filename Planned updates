Planned things for future updates:

v1.7:
Characters animations rework (with multiple frames for each animation, so animated animations I guess)

Future things with no defined update:
Health system tweaks (this game is way too easy compared to the original game, but idk how the original game health system work)
Improving animated backgrounds
Adding all animated backgrounds
