Planned things for future updates:
  
v1.8:
[X] Cleaned some code
[X] Now crashing won't make you quit the game. It will instead send you back to the main menu
[ ] Modcharts

Future things with no defined update:
  - Adding all animated backgrounds
  - Modifications (currently there is only 2: "hideNotes1" (opponent) and "hideNotes2" (player), more will be added later), can be modified with simple modcharts
  - Modcharts. There will be 2 types:
    - Simple modcharts. It will be a json file with simple commands allowing to edit the predefined modifications that are already coded in the program
    - Complex modcharts. It is recommended to create them while running the Python edition of the game, and then distribute your mod by compiling the game in a exe file.
      It is also recommended to have a great understanding of how the game is working (I will probably make video tutorials when the game is completely finished)
      It will be Python scripts executing with the song, so they will allow to make many complex things, but will be harder to make
  - Editing gameplay elements to allow them to be edited by complex modcharts
  - Adding multiple note types
