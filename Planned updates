Planned things for future updates:

v1.7:
- Characters animations rework (with multiple frames for each animation, so animated animations I guess)
More detailed:
  Done:
  - Fixed characters not appearing on certain conditions (I think Python >=3.9 and EduPython)
  - Improved display for display with a resolution inferior to 1080p
  - Fixed the some maths, now animated backgrounds will display correctly, with their speed changed according to the bpm (faster bpm = faster animation)
  Still in developpement:
  - Animation rework (XML file reading done)
  - Some modded things (modcharts)

Future things with no defined update:
  - Adding all animated backgrounds
  - Modifications (currently there is only 2: "hideNotes1" (opponent) and "hideNotes2" (player), more will be added later), can be modified with simple modcharts
  - Modcharts. There will be 2 types:
    - Simple modcharts. It will be a json file with simple commands allowing to edit the predefined modifications that are already coded in the program
    - Complex modcharts. It is recommended to create them while running the Python edition of the game, and then distribute your mod by compiling the game in a exe file.
      It is also recommended to have a great understanding of how the game is working (I will probably make video tutorials when the game is completely finished)
      It will be Python scripts executing with the song, so they will allow to make many complex things, but will be harder to make
  - Editing gameplay elements to allow them to be edited by complex modcharts
