How to add a background:
- Create a folder in assets\Images\Backgrounds
- Rename it with the name of your background
- Add your background image in it, and name it Background0.png
- Create a stageData.json file
- Add `{"numFrames": 1}` in it
- Go to the song where you want to add the background
- Create a songData.json file if there is not already one
- Add 
```"stage": background name```
in the songData.json file (if your song has a background and no characters it should look like this: `{"stage": background name}`)
- Your song now uses the background you created!

How to add an animated background:
- Add multiple images named Background followed by the number of the frame (the first frame is Background0.png, the second one is Background1.png etc...)
- Set "numFrames" in the stageData.json file to the number of frame that your background has
- Your background should now be animated based on the bpm of the song
