Reworked the long notes system, they are now integrated to gameplay!
How they work:
- If you miss a note and it has a long note attached to it, you will have only 1 miss, the long note can't deal damage
- If you hit a note and it has a long note attached to it, the long note will be able to deal damage
- If you release a long note too early and you hit less than 75% of it, you will get a miss
- If you release a long note too early and you hit more than 75% of it, you won't get a miss (so if you miss a little bit of the long note in the end of it you won't get a miss)
- When a long note can't deal damage, it will appear transparent
Tell me what you think about this mechanic and if I need to change something!
The game is now available as a .exe file! (Took me 3 days to figure out how to do this XD)
